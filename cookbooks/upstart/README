This cookbook for upstart is primary for the custom upstart_event resource.


UpstartEvent
============

The upstart_event resource is to make emitting events to upstart from chef cleaner, easier to modify, and just look nicer. upstart_event is based on the execute resource, and as such it shares all of execute's actions and attributes. The only attributes really needed however are those listed below:

Actions
-------

- :run
- :nothing

Attributes
----------

wait
    Whether to block until job started by event completes, or to run it in the
    background.

    default value
        true

event
    the event to emit

    default value
        name

variables
    this is a hash of key:value pairs to send with the event




Example
-------

The following resource::

    upstart_event "start-dbload" do
      action :nothing
      wait false
      variables(
        :dbname => "mydb",
        :sdb_domain => "chef",
        :sdb_key => "localhost",
        :clean_dump => "/mnt/cleandb.sql.gz",
        :config_script => "/mnt/config_db.sql"
      )
    end


Would result in the following command being executed::

    /sbin/initctl emit --no-wait start-dbload dbname=mydb sdb_domain=chef sdb_key=localhost clean_dump=/mnt/cleandb.sql.gz config_script=/mnt/config_db.sql
