The misc cookbook is for recipes that I can't think of a better place to put.

At the time of writing, the misc cookbook contains the following recipes:

base_pkgs
    packages I expect to always be present on every server (vim, gawk, git, etc)

bashrc
    puts custom bashrc in place for users identified in the attribute node.misc.users

dotssh_dir
    creates the .ssh directory in the homedir for users identified in the attribute node.misc.users, and ensures it has the correct permissions.

dotssh_files
    creates the .ssh/authorized_keys file for users identified in the attribute node.misc.users, and ensures it has the correct permissions.

mounts
    formats block devices identified in node.mounts (a hash of block device => mount point) with ext3 (if they have no filesystem already. not yet tested with block devices formatted with filesystems other than ext3), and then mounts the filesystem as specified.
