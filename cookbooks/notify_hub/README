The entire purpose of this cookbook is to provide a 'notify_hub' resource.

notify_hub resources are exactly what the name says it is - a hub for notifications. They are useful in a number of ways:
-Provide a simple common name to subscribe to.
-Chaining (resource A notifies the notify_hub, which causes all notifications associated with the hub to be triggered)
-Make reuse of a series of events easier, reducing duplication of code.
-Makes recipes simpler and easier to read.
