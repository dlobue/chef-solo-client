This is the very core of all cookbooks. This cookbook contains a number of tools which replace functionality otherwise only found when using chef-client with chef-server.

This cookbook's primary purpose is to provide:
-Persisting of attributes to a database backend (currently only AWS SimpleDB is supported)
-Searching said database backend for servers running dependency services (ie- so that addresses of memcached or db servers don't have to be hard-coded).
-Global semaphore (or lock) (so that your site doesn't go down when all your servers start upgrading nginx to the latest version at the same time).
-Resources for downloading files and artifacts from AWS S3

As a bonus it provides lots of other things as well (probably too much actually, probably should be refactored):
-Keeping the authorized_keys file in sync with a secure centralized source (S3) to make granting and revoking access simple.
-Deregistration from central database on shutdown.
-Acquisition of credentials from a secure store (S3).
